# eCommerce Transactions Dataset Assignment

This repository contains the solutions for the eCommerce Transactions Dataset assignment. The tasks include Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), building a Lookalike Model, and performing Customer Segmentation/Clustering. Below is a summary of the tasks and deliverables:

## Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights

### Description:
Perform EDA on the provided dataset to understand data distributions and extract meaningful insights.

### Deliverables:
- **EDA Code**: A Jupyter Notebook/Python script containing the EDA process.
- **Insights Report**: A PDF summarizing at least 5 key business insights (maximum 500 words).

### Files:
- `Vaibhav_More_EDA.ipynb`
- `Vaibhav_More_EDA.pdf`

## Task 2: Lookalike Model

### Description:
Develop a Lookalike Model to recommend 3 similar customers for each user based on profile and transaction history. Assign similarity scores to each recommendation.

### Deliverables:
- **Recommendations**: `Lookalike.csv` with mappings: `Map<CustomerID, List<CustomerID, Score>`.
- **Model Development Code**: A Jupyter Notebook/Python script explaining the logic.

## Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering

### Description:
Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques based on profile and transaction data. Use clustering metrics, including Davies-Bouldin Index, to evaluate the clusters.

### Deliverables:
- **Clustering Results Report**: A PDF containing clustering metrics, the number of clusters, and visualizations.
- **Clustering Code**: A Jupyter Notebook/Python script containing the implementation.
